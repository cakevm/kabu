# Tips & Tricks

This section contains various tips and tricks for working with the Kabu framework effectively.

## Component Development

When developing components, keep these tips in mind:

1. **Use the Builder Pattern**: Components should provide builder methods for configuration
2. **Handle Errors Gracefully**: Use proper error handling and logging
3. **Test in Isolation**: Write unit tests for component logic separately from the messaging infrastructure

## Performance Optimization

1. **Channel Sizing**: Size channels based on expected throughput
2. **Parallel Processing**: Use tokio's concurrency features effectively
3. **State Management**: Minimize lock contention with Arc<RwLock<T>>

## Debugging

1. **Enable Tracing**: Use `RUST_LOG=debug` to see detailed logs
2. **Monitor Channels**: Track channel depths and message flow
3. **Component Lifecycle**: Log component startup and shutdown
